 <li>Non personal minimalism

 <li>Ringtones (what is more digitally wholesome?)
 <li>Murder
 <li>Non-personal minimalism
		 <li>Earning money and spending it on the right things</li><br />
	 
<p><small>*It must be clarified that this should NOT be frivolous or thoughtless recklessness. Of course, in line
with the rest of what’s IN it will be genuine and sincere, which then excuses the normally absurd or
ridiculous actions. This is a result of doing what you feel, regardless of what would be NORMAL.<br />
 **See footnote 4.<br />
***Writing a letter would be the obvious example here, but it is important to note that this should NOT
turn into a performative “oh I’m writing a LETTER on PAPER” kind of communication. Don’t make a
thing of it! This also then extends to digital communication, like texting or FB messenger.
Personalization is obviously personal, so this will likely mean various things for different people, but
the role of GENUINENESS is most important.</small></p>
	 
	 <br />
	 <h3>OUT</h3>
	  <li>Pettiness
 <li>Performative Hedonism
 <li>Emotional minimalism
 <li>Pisces/leos
 <li> Hating geminis
 <li>Anything pertaining to or reminiscent of the baroque
 <li>Dinner parties with much put-on
 <li>Traveling for the sake of traveling
 <li>“fuck you mom and dad” (petty!)
 <li>Being really into social media
 <li>Dairy
 <li>Heavy ironic photo editing
 <li>Filters
 <li>Smoked salmon (other smoked foods are IN)
 <li>Threesomes as a “thing”
 <li>Fetishes and kinks that are actually common^
 <li>Being a “gin person”
 <li>Whiskey
 <li>Lipstick
 <li> Baby bangs
 <li>Shoulders and midriffs
 <li>Skirts
 <li>Creativity expressed only through hair and glasses
 <li>Heavy contour makeup and eyelashes
 <li>Intense/overdone Nails
 <li> Middle ground haircuts^^
	  <li>Finstas
 <li>Heavy rosemary
 <li>Miniatures
 <li>Boyfriend or girlfriend
 <li>Tokenizing Jstor
	 <li>Being a friend who doesn’t text back</li>
	 <br />
	 <p><small>^4 This is clearly the counterpart to the not making a thing of choking. Basically, everyone is weird or
aggressive sexually, so there is no need to overperform how much you like it as a personality trait.
Don’t stop liking it, just maybe don’t classify it as a !!fetish!! or a !!kink!! Not wholesome! Liking it is,
though, as long as it’s genuine.<br />
		 ^^5 Basically, go short or long. The middle ground is over done and is hardly even a look, but it also
		 doesn’t matter given “creativity expressed only through haircuts” being out.</small></p><br />
	 
	 <h3>Notes on the List</h3>
	 <p class="tab">This semi-year list takes on a less individualistic tone than Summer 16.
Decidedly, 2016’s “quiet confidence” is becoming or will become interpersonal.
Trimming the social fat turns into more genuine, humble communication (and
therefore a change in how we use social media and talk about it and on it). 2017 is
about a shift from hedonism or minimalism into a both more multi-dimensional and
simpler WHOLESOME EXCESS. Or, potentially, maximal minimalism. That is,
personal minimalism, or minimalism that retains joy and expression and
romanticism for the sake of purity and sincerity. It is decisively not sterile
minimalism but a lived-in version. This year’s list possesses the image of a diner.
Local and unpretentious, yes; the same as anywhere else and special only because of
familiarity, likely. It is highly necessary to understand that this wholesomeness is
not synonymous with conservatism. In fact, it connotes more of a humbleness and
generosity. Acting upon feelings thoughtfully is key, and while this may come off as
emotionally reckless, it is just that people will be thinking and acting more
independently of what they “should” do. This is extremely important in the changing
		 political and social climate.</p>
 <p class="tab">Additionally, while it isn’t out, persay, self-care will take a bit of a backseat to
caring for a few people around you as well. Not a backseat, maybe, but the passenger
seat. Wholesomeness is also a type of cleanliness, which will be seen in clothing and
	 makeup.</p>
 <p class="tab">Communication is especially important as a facet of this new turn. Pettiness,
ubiquitous especially in Fall of 2016, must realize that it’s time to go. Additionally,
with its aging and therefore ever-decreasing novelty (despite short-term surges),
we will use social media less performatively. It will not be a separate piece of life or
ultra-performative platform, but it will merge with it and be a pathway for genuine
communication, especially more private. A few weeks ago, I was talking about how
much I love twitter. While my sentiment is still true, this kind of mindset is out. I
don’t love twitter, I love what I can use it for which is verbal expression and
communication (consider what this may mean for the concept of DMs and sliding
into them). Allowing social media to overtake its purpose of communication is NOT
wholesome, although using it frequently for genuine communication and not for the
sake of using social media is excessive wholesomeness. A hierarchy in media as
communication platforms still remains, but there will be some evening of the
playing field. Instagram is still not an acceptable medium for important
	 conversations, however, if others are available.</p>
	 <p class="tab"><b>A note on memes:</b> the starter pack, although used by a range of social groups,
admirable to deplorable, is in many ways the perfect format. Therefore, while
applications of it may seem out, it is in fact a staple for the time being. Memes, like
most things on the Internet, are short-lived. They are digital insects, flitting around
and dying after a rather short time—but only once they have also reproduced by the
millions. So, therefore, they must be judged somewhat differently in regards to
timelines/groups. In fact, one major sign of the oncoming era of wholesomeness was
in a way predicted by the slew of “wholesome memes” that existed largely on
alternative media platforms, only lightly showing up on Facebook. Pettiness as a
meme—think Joanne the Scammer (sorry for making you think of that)--gave way to
more wholesome types. Additionally, although vine is decisively out, the

consumption of quick videos, especially on Instagram and Facebook, will remain a
staple, although their novelty will go down and their presence as a kitsch medium
		 will increase.</p> <p class="tab">A continue in the return to painting will be seen in art, given its ability to stay
	 in line with previously mentioned tenets of the time.</p>
