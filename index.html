      <h3>IN</h3>
	 
	 <li><b> Wholesome excess</b> 	 <img src="wink.png" alt="wink" style="float:right; width="500" height="172">
 <li>Giving people a chance, but disliking them if you do///trusting first impressions but
recognizing bias

media)
 <li>Openly reckless romantic behavior*
 <li>Relaxed monogamy
 <li>Tension
 <li> PDA
 <li>Non personal minimalism
 <li>Terrifying truths
 <li>Gossiping but truthfully (NO pettiness, just keeping updated!)
 <li>Transparency
 <li>Using your full vocabulary (not performatively or pretentiously—rather find the right

 <li>Reading for pleasure
 <li>Musical niches
 <li>Minimal but striking eye makeup, skin left as is/emphasized irregularity
 <li>Asymmetric jewelry and makeup

 <li>Murder
 <li>Non-personal minimalism
		 <li>Earning money and spending it on the right things</li><br />
	 
<p><small>*It must be clarified that this should NOT be frivolous or thoughtless recklessness. Of course, in line
with the rest of what’s IN it will be genuine and sincere, which then excuses the normally absurd or
ridiculous actions. This is a result of doing what you feel, regardless of what would be NORMAL.<br />
 **See footnote 4.<br />
***Writing a letter would be the obvious example here, but it is important to note that this should NOT
turn into a performative “oh I’m writing a LETTER on PAPER” kind of communication. Don’t make a
thing of it! This also then extends to digital communication, like texting or FB messenger.
Personalization is obviously personal, so this will likely mean various things for different people, but
the role of GENUINENESS is most important.</small></p>
	 
	 <br />
	 <h3>OUT</h3>
	  <li>Pettiness
 <li>Performative Hedonism
 <li>Emotional minimalism
 <li>Pisces/leos
 <li> Hating geminis
 <li>Anything pertaining to or reminiscent of the baroque
 <li>Dinner parties with much put-on
 <li>Traveling for the sake of traveling
 <li>“fuck you mom and dad” (petty!)
 <li>Being really into social media
 <li>Dairy
 <li>Heavy ironic photo editing
 <li>Filters
 <li>Smoked salmon (other smoked foods are IN)
 <li>Threesomes as a “thing”
 <li>Fetishes and kinks that are actually common^
 <li>Being a “gin person”
 <li>Whiskey
 <li>Lipstick
 <li> Baby bangs
 <li>Shoulders and midriffs
 <li>Skirts
 <li>Creativity expressed only through hair and glasses
 <li>Heavy contour makeup and eyelashes
 <li>Intense/overdone Nails
 <li> Middle ground haircuts^^
	  <li>Finstas
 <li>Heavy rosemary
 <li>Miniatures
 <li>Boyfriend or girlfriend
 <li>Tokenizing Jstor
	 <li>Being a friend who doesn’t text back</li>
	 <br />
	 <p><small>^4 This is clearly the counterpart to the not making a thing of choking. Basically, everyone is weird or
aggressive sexually, so there is no need to overperform how much you like it as a personality trait.
Don’t stop liking it, just maybe don’t classify it as a !!fetish!! or a !!kink!! Not wholesome! Liking it is,
though, as long as it’s genuine.<br />
		 ^^5 Basically, go short or long. The middle ground is over done and is hardly even a look, but it also
		 doesn’t matter given “creativity expressed only through haircuts” being out.</small></p>
